  When our second semester begins everyone will be busy chatting with their friends, telling each other about what they did during their summer vacation. Some students may talk about their trips around our nation, others may talk about their trips abroad, other friends may talk about their diet challenges, and others may talk about courses they have taken so that they could acquire a license of some sort. And then there are those who did absolutely nothing but just stay home.
 However, there aren’t that many people who have successfully completed everything they planned during their vacation. The so-called trips they went on just turned out to be ‘fun’, or the diets they planned turned out to be huge and utter failures. Obtaining a license of some sort was harder than expected, and well. What do you know! Suddenly, the second semester has already begun! We know that this can’t be all, but it is what it is. Vacations tend to end up as over-planned disappointments.
 There are many reasons for why we fail, but one of the main causes is a lack of motivation towards achieving our goals. Setting a specific goal is certainly important. If we lose that direction and focus, it becomes very hard to go on as scheduled. This is when most of us begin to give up; since we have lost our motivation we become lazy. Having motivation helps us to stay strong and energetic. It gives us the will to accomplish our goals. Even if we sometimes fail, as long as we have the motivation, it will help us to try harder next time. 
 As we start a new semester I’m sure everyone has already began creating goals that they’d like to accomplish. So this time begin your plan with some motivation. These motivations can come 　from trips, books, role models, etc. Whatever floats your boat is fine. For me, I always felt that I lacked concentration, but reading a book called Think Hard has helped me improve my concentrations skills. Through my experiences and this article I hope everybody else can also accomplish something meaningful in their lives.

  Investment Techniques, How to Start?
  For Those Who are Starting in Investments!
  In modern society, there are few people who haven’t heard the term, ‘investment techniques’. Everyday books about investment plans and information techniques are published and financial articles fill the internet. You may start to ask yourself “What on earth are ‘investment techniques’ and why do we need them?” The answer to that question, ‘why do we need them?’ is that the day will come when we need to start preparing ourselves for the future ahead of us. We need to start saving money economically, and the best way to do that is by investing at an early stage. I would like to introduce two books: 1. The Skills of Saving and 2. Investments People in Their 20’s Should Do. 
  The Skills of Saving focuses on saving money. Everyone knows that saving is the foundation of investments. Many people also know that saving money is the safest way to retain money, but savings accounts don’t always bring about successful results. There are many different ways to save such as, savings plan-installments, tax-free savings, subscriptions, or pension investment products. All we really need to do is find the way that best suits our personal needs. This book contains information about savings plans, techniques for saving money, and bad money saving techniques. The author also talks about his own personal stories which help the reader more easily understand skills for saving. 
  
  However, the current base rate for savings is about 3%, remarkably low compared to our parents’ generation, which was about 15~20%. In an age of low interest rates, it is very difficult for us to save from pure interest. The second book, Investments People in Their 20’s Should Do, focuses primarily on investments because it says that people in their 20’s and investing have something in common; courage and the will to take risks. The author states that today’s twenty year olds can make ‘seed money,’ and they also have plenty of time to do so. This is what is so special about the young people today. This book definitely provides helpful methods that will lead you to successful investments.
  These two books have some common key points. The first key point is having a consistent mindset and patience. In investments, there are some people who are lucky enough to earn large sums of money in short period of time, but that’s a rare occurrence. The keys to a successful investment is by ‘thinking that you are in for a long marathon,’ which basically means to be patient. The second, is to set specific goals. Don’t have a mindset of earning a lot of money, but set a specific amount of money that you want to save instead. Also have a motive for why you want to save up. For what purpose do you need savings? And last but not least, don’t waste money on futile things. Spend your money wisely and always have economical sense. By thinking economically, we can improve our investments. So use public transportation instead of driving, and eat in, not out. Small things like this can add to become a major boost, so be smart and make the right choices.
  If I were to recommend something to our fellow college students it’s this, take courses that involve accounting or economics. In order for us to become used to investments, we should get accustomed to the economy. Furthermore, you should have some knowledge in finance as well. By taking accounting or economic courses you can acquire the knowledge of how to invest much more easily. Don’t miss the chance to earn your own money and prepare yourself for a bright future. The important thing is to succeed. The map is drawn for us and the directions are given, all we need to do now is live up to the challenge and start walking towards success, step by step.

  ''' Do you like K-pop? I love K-pop. I'm a huge fan of many groups. The reason why I like K-pop is related to how I want to make my memories.
  There are many dramas made based on memories. I want to talk about 응답하라 series, especially 응답하라 1997. In the drama, there's a character named 시원. She is a high school student who likes a boy group called H.O.T. She goes to concerts, shares pictures in a magazine with her friends and even goes to meet her bias in person. Also, cheers for them with balloons and writes letters to them.
  The culture of fandom is different from nowadays but vibe of the formal days is fun and interesting to know so I was very impressed. But the culture of these days is also interesting.
  Now K-pop is popular all around the world and by that, many techniques have been developed. People cheer with light sticks instead of balloons, uses NS or sites only for fans to communicate, apply for signing events to see celebrities in person and talk, or even pay for an application that can talk with a member they want like a one to one chat room. 
  To think about the stream of fandom culture, it is very odd and amazing that someday the culture I am experiencing right now can be another old time story, and my memories can be remade into another content like drama, spread all over the world. 
  Being a fangirl for several years, I experienced many things. I once skipped school and went to a concert. I was tired and hungry, but all the hard times of then are kept as good memories with videos I took at that time and the cap of the water bottle he sprinkled. The other time, I went to a musical a day before an exam and screwed it up. But after a while it also became a fun memory I can talk about now, and I am satisfied with it.
  Of course I didn't live my life postponed to my fangirling. It also motivated me to study. One of the members I like was from the U.S.A and he used to speak English on his NS or radio he hosted. I wanted to understand what he was saying so I started to study English. As a result my grades got better as well as my English skills. Gradually, learning English became my major so, I guess I said everything about this part.
  Being a fangirl is a happy experience but there were also some troubles. For example trouble with parents, or spending time and passion. But I think it was because I'm a lazy person. Anyway still I think these hard times are some parts of making memories. Happy memories remain long, but happy memories in hard times remain longer so right now I am living a life making memories for future me to reminiscent who I liked and how passionate I was.
  I could look back at my fangirl times to write these sentences. It was also a fun time looking back my memories. If you haven't been a fan of someone, it doesn't have to be a person but I recommend you to like something passionately since it can be a precious memory when you look back.

   In 2003, Kyungwon Universitiy signed an academic exchange agreement with Ritsumeikan University, located in Kyoto, Japan. Ritsumeikan's main campus is located in Kyoto and their Biwako-Kusatsu Campus (BKC) is located in Shiga. They also have an affiliated campus in Oita which opened up in 2000.

 ROTC is No Longer Exclusively for Men
Introducing Female ROTC at Kyungwon University
 Have you ever heard of ROTC (Reserve Officers' Training Corps)? ROTC is a superior training course that selects excellent applicants, who are college students. For two years the ROTC teaches students military knowledge while they take majoring courses at the same time. Last year, Korea introduced the American female ROTC system to Universities around Korea. 
 Last year, sixty female ROTC cadets were selected to demonstrate their skills from seven separate universities. The seven universities were: Sookmyung Women's University, Kangwon University, Korea University, Myungji University, YoungNam University, Chonnam University, and Chungnam University. Sookmyung Women's University entered 30 cadets, whereas all other universities entered 5 cadets each. Starting this year, all universities that have the ROTC programs will be accepting female members who have completed up to two years of college. 
 The second recruitment of female ROTC will select 250 cadets this year. The females are not selected per school like the men are, but selected per region. Students will be chosen from six different regions (Kwangwon, Gyeongsang, Chungcheong, Jeolla, Seoul, Gyeonggi), and 320 students will be selected after taking a required written exam. Kyungwon University students will compete with students from other universities in the Gyeonggi region. With female ROTC, application requirements and selection procedures are the same with those of male ROTC cadets. However, for long distance running, females are required to run only 1.2KM compared to the males' requirement of 1.5KM. Next, there are group discussions, interviews, personally directed questions, and posture and stance examinations. After all these tests are done, documents are checked so that there will be no problems during the enrollment procedure.In the end 25 students will be selected for the 2nd class of female ROTC members. During the first stage, the ROTC program selected 50 candidates that were reduced to 38 cadets on June 10th. Then in mid-August they will announce the final 25 members. 
 Starting this year, Kyungwon University has recruited female ROTC candidates. A total of 33 students have applied, and 32 have taken the exam. Out of these students from Kyungwon University, two students have successfully passed the first stage of the test. Kyungwon University was very supportive towards the students by handing out expected question sheets. And to help them prepare for the physical exam, Kyungwon University helped the students train and provided them with supportive goods such as headbands and protein shakes. 
 Currently, as of the announcement of second stage winners, two applicants from Kyungwon University have passed. These future heroes are Kim Aram (majoring in Accounting) and Park Inae (majoring in Nursing). Kim Aram said that the desire to become a soldier was inspired by her father, who is a professional military man, and her sister who is also an officer. She pointed out that being in the ROTC while attending school has many benefits. Park Inae said that even though signing up for the ROTC means that she has to give up her hopes of working for a hospital right after graduating; she feels that joining the ROTC is a positive thing. Park says that even in the military there are positions where a woman is required. The 52nd class of Kyungwon University's ROTC marks the first time that female students have applied; therefore, this holds a deep and historic meaning.

 What Do You Think When You Hear the Word 'Ad'?
The Gwangjuri Club, Dankook University's Advertisement Club, has the 'ANSWER'.
 Could you introduce yourself briefly?
 You can just talk about the Gwangjuri club and your position in it? 
Hello? I'm Gang Gun, the 11th team leader of'Gwangjuri.' The team leader's job is to make schedules, incorporate group ideas, hold conferences, and produce ads. However, usually a group leader helps with these tasks when we prepare to exhibit we work in groups.
Please introduce Gwangjuri, and its history and what it does. 
 Our name stands for a round basket (Gwangjuri), and we try to include many people, as well as many ideas, just as a 'Gwangjuri' (round basket) holds various items. There is also a hidden meaning within the name that our club is for people who love 'Gwang'-go ads and alcoholic drinks (酒—“ju”).
 The highest prize we have been awarded is the grand prize at Kobaco ad competition. We also have been recognized for work on a university student contest exhibit at Cheil, a university student contest exhibit at the Sport Chosun Ilbo, and a KT&G imagination contest. We have also been awarded many other prizes awarded, small and big.Also, we have many club alumni that are very famous and working for advertising agencies. Inbok Lee is one of our most famous alumni, and he is also the founder of our club!
What is the motto of Gwangjuri?
 Our group doesn't exist in order to win the prizes at contests, but instead to create a good family-like atmosphere for our members. We are more than just a club, and we always think of our teammates as family.

Advertisement is often called an 'Idea Battle'. Where do you get your ideas, and what do youdo to get inspired in your daily life?
Usually when we organize our ideas, we gather ideas for each team, and share what we think freely.We regularly gather all the members of Gwangjuri  to present each team's ideas, and then we appraise them and give feedback openly. These methods help us to develop our personal ideas by taking in other's opinions.
 We cooperate and endeavor not as individuals but as groups. I think that ingenious ideas don't pop out suddenly, so we start from the basics and seek out interesting concepts that embody the objective of the advertisement.
How do you prepare for competitions, and how do you make ads? Tell us about the process.How does 'Gwangjuri' share its workload, and how many people work together?
 When we begin preparing for a contest, we organize the students by experience and the school year of each member. Then I set a date to gather all of the members. Usually senior students become group leaders, but we have open discussions and do not emphasize the term 'group leader.' The group leader's responsibility is to make sure that the given task is completed by the deadline. Currently we have25 Visual Design major students in 'Gwangjuri.' 

There are many advertising clubs at other universities. What makes 'Gwangjuri' special?What do people at Dankook University think about 'Gwangjuri'?
 Every club has its own pride and features.
First, I want to point out we encourage 'A family-like mood,' in our group.
 Second, I think that we make great achievements and become successful because we socialize and enjoy what we do. Our main goal isn't about winning the prize, but enjoying our club activities to the fullest. 
 Third, I must not forget to mention our senior members who have already graduated. Even though they have graduated, they don't forget about us and often give us good advice about work and help us. 
 I don't know what the university thinks of us because we are just a club that exists within our department. But we are really famous in the department of Art.
I think this would be last question. What do you want to say to students who try to 
work in the advertisement business?
 I don't think I am in the position to talk about this kind of topic yet, but if I were to say something I would say this, “Do whatever you think is important, and do it without remorse and never hold back.” It's always good to prepare yourself for the future, and now is the time that you can accomplish everything you want to. So go out there and grab it! 
And personally I really want to make advertisements that truly inspire and move the people in my life. Thank you!!

  Protect Your Personal Information!
What Would You Do If Someone Asks You for Personal Information?
Do you know that your personal information is spreading without your permission or knowledge? As we enter a cybernetic age, most people these days all use the internet. This has led computer hackers to hack into our personal information, stealing it for their own benefit. Our personal information is stored on various websites everywhere, such as public and medical institutes. It is because of these hackers, bad things happen to our personal information, such as identity theft, spamming, defamation, or even financial theft. Therefore, we must always be very cautious in giving out our personal information. Privacy is most important when it comes to our personal information. So let's find out what types of hacking methods are out there, and how we can reduce the chances of identity theft while protecting our information.
The first hacking method is databaseleakage.
Databases can leak personal information. There are many ways in which databases can be hacked. For example, someone from the inside can give out the information for their own personal gain such as money, administrators could make mistakes in guarding the information, or hackers can simply hack into the system and steal it. There have been plenty of hacking incidents at famous online shopping sites such as Auction. Hyundai Capital Service and the National Agricultural Corporation have also been damaged due to database hacking. In these types of incidents, we are help less from preventing the hackers from stealing our information.
The second hacking method is phishing.
Phishing sites and phishing emails are created for the sole purpose of gaining your personal information. These sites commonly approach online users by showing a screen saying that they have just won a prize, or simply by emailing false information. One example of phishing is an email that says that you can track people who visit your Cyworld or Facebook page. These are most likely false because those types of programs are not distributed by entering your personal info. Sometimes just clicking on the site already leaks your info. So next time, be very careful on what you click and what you sign up for.
This is a photo of a phishing site that plagiarizes the Agricultural Cooperative Bank. It deceives the users by implying that they are the bank. These phishing sites are not only fake banks, but they have blanks that tell you to put in your account number. So always be sure to check the website, and always use your online certificates.
The third hacking method is 'spyware'
By simply typing in your password and ID, any 'spyware' installed on your PC can steal your information. In addition, personal information that is sent to the network might also be stolen as well. These 'spyware' programs are sent through either e-mail or Active X installation. When accessing an Adult website, these fake Active X screens pop up a lot, so next time you see an Active X install screen you should think twice before clicking it. Another way of preventing a fake Active X pop up is by changing your settings on Internet Explorer.
Fllow the procedure to prevent illegal Active X from popping up.
Internet Explorer -> Tools -> Internet Options 
Sites that are not cleared to install the ActiveX should be avoided if possible. In addition, security programs with live monitoring should be operated to avoid viruses.
The fourth hacking method is publishing a password.
This means that people literally just guess different types of passwords. This happens from people around you.
Usually people tend to select their password very similar to their ID like in the picture above. By making your password similar to your username, it becomes much easier for others to hack into your accounts. To avoid this from ever happening you should do the following: 
1. Avoid identity and character duplications.
2. Avoid same or continuous numbers.
3. Avoid date of births, and phone numbers.
4. Create long passwords, and preferably make different passwords for each site.
The fifth hacking method is online messaging
This type of fraud is very simple, as random people start a conversation with you claiming that they are your friend. Then they ask you to send some money via account or online banking. Most of people won't make mistakes like this, but some people are overly kind and sometimes gullible so always be careful. Therefore, even if it is your PC at home or a PC in a public place, never set your ID to Auto-Log-in mode and do not save your username either.
Don't ever share personal information through chatting programs because they are the easiest way of hacking.
Here are some extra preventing methods of information leakage:
1. Avoid using finance related sites on public PC's or in PC rooms.
2. Always keep your online certificates on your USB.
3. Log off to make sure that nobody can use your personal information.
4. Change your password often.
5. Do not transmit personal information through E-mail or instant messaging (even your resume).
6. Occasionally check for identity theft and personal information disclosure diagnostic sites.
(Related sites: personal information disclosure diagnostic site http://www.realscan.co.kr/index.jsp
http://www.siren24.com/c2alimi/index.jsp)Verify Identity Theft Sites @ - 

In addition, there is a system called 'i-PIN' (internet Personal Identification Number). For this you enter your resident registration numberinstead of having an ID or a password. By using this system we can greatly reduce the risk of having your personal information stolen.

   Just Comics? No, It's a Movie.
Why People Love Marvel Comics Heroes.
 Spiderman, Hulk, The Fantastic 4, Ironman, Thor: God of Thunder, X-Men – First Class and The First Avenger: Captain America. Do you know what these movies all have in common? The origins of these movies are all from Marvel Comics that have been turned into a successful motion pictures series.
What Is Marvel Comics
 Now the next question is what is 'Marvel comics'? Most of us have all heard of these movies before and Marvel Comics is the brand that created them. Marvel comics is a well-known American comic book publisher that is famous for comics such as Captain America, X-Men, The Fantastic 4, Hulk, Thor, Ironman, Dr. Strange, Blade, Punisher, Dare Devil, Iron Fist and Ghost Rider. 
Marvel Comics Movies in 2011
Thor: God of Thunder 
<Thor: God ofThunder, 2011.4.28>
X-Men – First Class
<X-men; The FirstClass, 2011.6.2>
Captain America: The First Avenger
<Captain America: The First Avenger, 2011.7.28>
Interesting Features of Marvel Comics Movies
 There is an interesting common feature in all the movies that I have mentioned, and that is the unexpected guest star appearance of Stan Lee. Stan Lee is the creator and founder of Marvel Comics and is known to be the father of Marvel Comics throughout the comic world. He is currently the chairman and producer of the Marvel movies. When you first watch the movies you probably don't notice him at first, but try watching it again, and this time pay close attention. I think these types of cameos are very interesting and a clever move by Stan Lee.
<X-men, 2000>
<DareDevil, 2003>
<Spiderman, 2004>
<Fantastic 4, 2005>
<X-men : The Last Stand, 2006>
<Spiderman3, 2007>
<Ironman, 2008>
<Incredible Hulk, 2008>
There Are Always Hints of a New Series at the End of Each Movie?!
 You should always watch the movies until the credits are all over because sometimes there are teasers of the next series once the credits are done showing. These hints can sometimes be an important key to expecting a new series. Let's take a look at some of the teasers shown at the end of the credits. 
* Spoiler Alert! Do not read if you haven't seen the following movies!
<X-Men – The last stand>
 At the end of the movie Magneto has become human, losing all his mutant powers after being injected with a serum by Beast. However, as he was sitting in a park by himself, he was able to move a pawn made of steel from a chessboard. This tells the audience that Magneto's powers are not completely vanished and it might be giving us a hint at something in the near future.
 Also after the credits are over, they show Professor Xavier, who died earlier in the movie, in a hospital bed. During the movie, Professor X taught his students that it is possible for someone to transfer their high-quality brain to another human who is in a vegetative condition. In the hospital bed, someone has apparently woken up, and the doctor saw the man and called him 'Charles!' So you see, Magneto didn't lose his powers, and apparently Professor Xavier didn't die since he did a mental transplant. This tells the fans of X-Men that the battle is not over, and it could very well continue on into a new series.
<The Incredible Hulk>
 Bruce Banner, who is the main character in the movie, has maintained stable for 31 days by the end of the movie. And as he was sitting down a caption was shown saying 'Non-change 0 days' with his eyes turning green. This shows the audience that Hulk now knows how to control his change and maintain his thoughts. This could suggest that a second film might be coming out as well.
<Ironman>
 Nick Fury, who is the director of 'SHIELD', is found in Tony Stark's house and tells Tony that he has come to him to talk about the 'Avengers' The Avengers is a comic series where a lot of super heroes are together on a team for the first time. So this was just a minor hint that the Avengers' movie is in production. 
<Ironman 2> 
 In this film the hint is related to the movie < Thor: God of Thunder> because they mention Thor's weapon the 'Mjolnir' The weapon was found in New Mexico when a mystery man called someone and said “Sir, I found it.”
Why Do We Love Marvel Comics Heroes?
 To change the question into a more fundamental one, why do we like heroes? I think it is because of the fact that we humans are limited and sometimes frustrated when we realize our limits in our world. But a hero on the other hand always finds a way to overcome these hardships, which makes the audience admire and envy them at the same time. Even though comparing a movie to a real life experience may seem dull, people admire these films because they are able to find hope.
Another reason why people enjoy Marvel Comics Heroes is because of the action scenes. In Spiderman, you can see a lot of acrobatic action, and in Thor you can witness raw power. In Ironman we can watch miracles happen with the technology of man, and in X-Men we can see all sorts of different powers all put into one movie. I think these various action scenes and powers are what overwhelms the audience and draws them into Marvel Comics. 
Next Upcoming Movies from Marvel Comics
 Would you believe it if someone told you that all of your favorite Marvel Comics heroes can team up together to fight other villains? Well you better believe it now because coming next year a movie with all your favorite Marvel Heroes will be released. The movie is called 'The Avengers', and the main characters will be: Ironman, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Hawkeye, Black Widow, Nick Fury and Captain America. 
 Unfortunately, Spiderman will not be in the movie due to copyright complications, but the movie will still be action packed. People are looking forward to the movie because they are curious to see how the filmmakers are going to set up the distinct and interesting relationships among the heroes. The movie is planned to be released next spring so mark your calendars.

   This Is How Our University Saves Energy! 
Energy Conservation: No Exceptions for Universities As Well! 
 Recently energy has emerged as a major issue because of the increase in gasoline prices due to situations such as the unrest in Libya. For this reason, Kyungwon University has decided to set energy saving policies thatbest suit our university. 
Last Digit on the Plate
No Vehicle Day
1, 6
Monday
2, 7
Tuesday
3, 8
Wednesday
4, 9
Thursday
5, 0
Friday
 The first policy is the regulation of on-campus vehicles. 
Kyungwon has decided to divide vehicles into 5 separate groups by the last digit on the license plates, andfrom there each group will be given a day where they cannot bring their vehicles. The groups are on the following chart. This policy does not apply on Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays. All diplomatic, emergency,
handicapped, and light-weight vehicles are excluded as well.
 The second policy is for the outdoor lighting system. The Vision Tower's lighting, line lightings, and the media walls are all required to be turned off when they are not used. As for the outdoor lighting, everything except for the street lights will be shut off. The lit advertisements at Saerom Hall and the International Language Center must be turned off. However, the tennis court is sometimes used for evening classes, so they will be selectively shut off only when they are not used. 
 The third policy is for the indoor lighting. All lights are required to be turned off by the managers of each building during lunchtime and when they finish the day. Personal and individual heating systems are prohibited. Also, the Vision Tower's gym has evening courses so they are permitted to use lights until 11:00 PM.
 This information is being advertised through the Kyungwon University website, and KEBS (Kyungwon Educational Broadcasting Station). The University asks the students for their support and cooperation to save energy.

   The Amazing Delivery Culture in Korea
 It has already been 5 months since I've been here in Korea as an exchange student. Not too long ago, I remember eating jajangmyun with a friend of mine and was very impressed by the quick delivery. I was impressed because at that time, I was very hungry and the delivery man came very quickly. The weather was very beautiful that day, and I was happy to enjoy my meal outside. When you order something in Korea, you are satisfied because in Korea they give you extra service. When you order a meal, they sometimes come with additional appetizers or beverages, and this makes the customers very happy. When I was back in Japan, I hardly ordered any food because in Japan, delivery food is usually only pizza, which can be expensive, and it also takes more than an hour to deliver.

 I think the delivery service in Korea is very similar to Korea's personality. Everything is so quick and fast if you order something then it is delivered to you in a heartbeat. One of my favorite take-out meals is chicken, and I was greatly amazed by the fact that they delivered chicken. Sometimes I don't feel like leaving my dormitory since the stores are all so far away. It was really nice to find out that I could order almost any type of food I wanted to eat. I think if there were to be a chicken delivery service in Japan, it would be very successful. Whenever I tell my friends about the idea, they all think it would be a great idea. Unfortunately on the downside, eating chicken late at night isn't always good news for your face in the morning, so that's a big problem.
 Another big comparison between Korea and Japan is the pizza delivery system. Pizza is the only delivery food that we have in Japan, but it is too expensive. For example, if I were to order a large sized pizza in Japan, it would cost me about 30,000won, whereas in Korea you can order it for half that price. Because of this high price, there aren't many people who actually order pizza in Japan. Can we only experience this low-priced delivery service in Korea? Are there any other countries like Korea?
 Sometimes I worry about the deliverymen because they travel so fast on their motorcycles. I love the fast service, but I do wish they would slow down a bit when they deliver. Well, if you ever come to Korea, I recommend that you experience the quick delivery service. It is a great culture that I wish my country would adopt someday.
